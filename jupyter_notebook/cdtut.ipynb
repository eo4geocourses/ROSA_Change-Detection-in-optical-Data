    "remote sensing allows acquiring information about the Earth's surface without actually being in contact with it and this is done by sensing and recording reflected or emitted energy [Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, 2007].<br>The data we get when observing the Eart by means of remote sensing is used to generate pixels - a picture element or data point in an image whose color depend on reflected or emitted energy at a given location. Pixels are characterised by the following types of resolution:</div>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Spatial resolution: the size of an image’s pixels, usually as measured by one side of the pixel (e.g., 10m, or 1km resolution). Equivalently, the number of pixels per unit area. Higher resolution (i.e. smaller pixels) images provide more detail by capturing fine scale variation in reflectance across a given area;</li>\n",

    "    <li>Radiometric resolution: Essentially,  refers to color depth, or how detailed the colors we can create when making color composite images; The finer the radiometric resolution of a sensor, the more sensitive it is to detecting small differences in reflected or emitted energy; remote sensing data can be 8 bit, 16 bit etc;</li>\n",

Some satellites operates as a constellation with multiple satellites working together to increase their global coverage daily (Miglarese, 2018)</li>\n",
