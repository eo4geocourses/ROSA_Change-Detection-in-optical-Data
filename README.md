# Change Detection Using EO Data 

The text provide introductory concepts on detecting changes using EO data. Considerations about quantitative vs qualitative assessment as well as methods and processing steps are also provided 

* Contents:
(1) How EO can help to detect changes; 
(2) Change detection methods;
(3) Quantity of changes; 
(4) Change detection in urban area using SAR data; 
(5) Change detection in Image Time Series;
  
* Learning outcomes: Explain resolution characteristics of remote sensing data in general and of Copernicus Sentinel 1 and 2 in particular; Explain operating principle of passive and active satellites; Example on how to detect changes by using a quantitative analysis on land use and land cover; Identify changes during 10 years period by usind Sentinel 1 data; Indicate and calculate vegetation indices derived from satellite data for change detection in image time series"
